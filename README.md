# nixos-IBM-Z10-mainframe

As im currently adding s390x support for nixos/nixpkgs I use this
to build system configurations testing out stuff. This repo
should contain some building blocks to build

- TODO (iso installer images)
- tarballs
- nixosSystem definitions that can be installed/used using nixos-install/nixos-rebuild

these can be used in an emulator or on an IBM Z10 mainframe since thats the once I got
but this should work for Z11-Z16 since s390x is s390x (more or less)
